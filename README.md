# Wearable-gesture-controlled-smart-jacket
This project has 3 features:
the first part detects the movement of the hand and plots an image of it in a hsv format and then the python detection script detects the coordinates of the finger tip and drags the mouse pointer to that coordinate. 
The second part is the implementation of the assistant. Assistant was created from scratch which listens to the conversation and whenever the keyword "6th sense" is said it gets triggred and performs functions such as calling, navigation, setting alarm, timer, reminder, it also searches the web.
Third and the final implementation is of heartbeat sensor and AED pads so in case of a cardiac arrest it gets triggered and sends notification to the doctor who can then triggers the AED pads.
